    context: `<p ><span style=""><span ><span >Dynamic pricing is used in many industries to maximise profits, particularly if businesses in those industries have high fixed costs and wildly fluctuating demand, like in hospitality.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ><span style=""><span ><span >Restaurants around the world frequently have &#39;net profit&#39; margins of only 2-6%. Interestingly however, restaurants actually have strong &lsquo;gross profit&rsquo; margins on food, </span></span></span><span style=""><span ><span ><b style="">averaging 65-70% in</b></span></span></span><span style=""><span ><span > India. The issue many venues face is volume and underutilisation i.e. Many empty tables during the day and a kitchen running at greatly reduced capacity.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ><span style=""><span ><span >At these times of underutilisation, fixed costs (staff, utilities and rent) can outweigh your revenue generated, resulting in loss-making times.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ><span style=""><span ><span >By utilising Bluedip customers to dine at your venue, you create extra volume at these off-peak times. As your fixed costs are set, the cost of serving an extra customer sits only in the food cost (industry avg. of 27%), so, if you offer a 25% off deal to those customers, for example, your gross profit can still be </span></span></span><span style=""><span ><span ><b style="">between 40-45%</b></span></span></span><span style=""><span ><span > on that customer&#39;s order. This brings in revenue that you otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have had and ultimately improves your net profit margin.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ><span style=""><span ><span >With the right dynamic pricing strategy, restaurant owners can increase off-peak revenue and cover their costs/make a profit at times when they would have previously made a loss, which is economically very beneficial.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ><span style=""><span ><span >On top of the economic benefits, dynamic pricing can attract early diners to build atmosphere (which helps attract full-paying walk-in customers), or to reduce food waste - whatever strategy suits your venue.</span></span></span></p>
